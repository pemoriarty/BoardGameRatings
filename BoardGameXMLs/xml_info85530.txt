							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Outlaws: Adventures in the Old West</name>
									
			<description>'The year is 1876. The small town of Deadrock is almost deserted; anyone with any sense had already left town. Only Sheriff Jim Murray and his deputies Samuel and Dale remain. Incarcerated in the town's jail is one of the Carson Gang, Luke Young.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jim watches as a cloud of dust approaches from the west. He knows it is the Carson Gang coming to get Luke. He picks up his trusty Winchester '73, barks a few instructions to Samuel and Dale, wearily walks to the window of his office and waits.....'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will Jim and his deputies see off the gang long enough for Marshall Samson and his men to arrive? Or will Jesse spring Luke in time and make their escape? Both men's fates are in your hands...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outlaws is a free Print &amp;amp; Play fast playing game of gunfights, bank heists and general shenanigans set in the Old West of America. Each character in the game has his own character card with which a player tracks what he holds and carries and any wounds he picks up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game can be played in two modes: stand alone scenarios called shootouts, and adventures where several scenarios are linked together into a larger storyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game system is based around an action track system where characters expend actions to perform activities. Wounds are represented by randomly drawn wound counters that may result in anything from a small leg graze to a belly wound that will get worse during the course of the game to a direct head shot that takes out a man immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial release of the game is titled; Outlaws: Adventures in the Old West - Episode One. Each episode will  include the base rules which run to 12 pages and include many illustrations on all aspects of play. There is also a Shootout and Adventure booklet containing scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Episode One there are 10 maps - each will print on a single US Letter or A4 page and will tile with each other to create a large range of environments in which scenarios are set. Episode one contains all you need to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
