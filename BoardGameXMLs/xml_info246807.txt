							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Mars Attacks: Le jeu – Massacre urbain</name>
									
			<description>Between the Martian invaders and their slaughter of everything in sight, and the US marines and their desperate fight to stop them, are the ordinary inhabitants of Greenville. Struggling to survive in a town that has become a warzone, these frightened individuals are just trying to keep their heads down. But sometimes, they get caught right in the crossfire. Even the cows aren&amp;rsquo;t safe in this intergalactic massacre&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This set provides you with five plastic pre-assembled civilians as well as three dead bodies and one flaming cow herd miniature for the Mars Attacks tabletop game, representing the true human (and bovine) cost of the invasion. These can be used instead of the cardboard counters in the boxed game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
