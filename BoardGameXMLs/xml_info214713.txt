			<description>Das neue Wien Quiz is a trivia game containing 220 question cards with three multiple choice answers each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in turns. Every player has to answer a question but can choose not to hear the multiple choices. If he opts to do so, he gets 3 points for the correct answer or 0 points if he was wrong. If he chooses to use the multiple choice option, he gets 2 points for the correct answer, but if answered wrong, he gets another chance but then only 1 point is awarded for the correct answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game ends at the end of a round in which a player collected 30 points. The player with the most points is the winner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
