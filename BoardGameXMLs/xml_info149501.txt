			<description>Marching to Richmond is a simple strategic game covering the  American Civil War in the region containing the two capitals; the map depicts most of Virginia, most of Maryland, and Pennsylvania as far north as Gettysburg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is very similar to that in Watt's The Peninsular War 1808-14; on each turn a player can spend 12 movement points among their forces, with a maximum of 6 per unit. Units can be moved by ship to a limited extent, and in this game also by railroad. Only one attack can be made each turn, with the outcome determined by die roll; the die results don't depend on the opposing forces at all, but the number of die rolls allowed depends on the number of attacking units and the defensive terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played to an agreed-upon time limit (2 hours is suggested) at which point a small fixed number of final turns is played. The Union player wins if they control enough Confederate cities (depending on whether they still control all of theirs or not), otherwise the Confederates win.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was originally published as a do-it-yourself kit (Watts' description) in 1974. A revised version titled &amp;quot;prototype trial edition&amp;quot; was published in 1989. It is unknown if a further edition was released.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
