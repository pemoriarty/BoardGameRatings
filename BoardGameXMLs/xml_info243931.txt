							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Hood&#039;s Last Gamble</name>
									
			<description>1864. After some maneuvering in northern Georgia in an attempt to disrupt Sherman's supply line, John Bell Hood moved the Confederate Army of Tennessee westward and then to the north. George Thomas's Army of the Cumberland, which was dispersed but growing, stood in the way. Hood's plan had objectives such as defeating scattered Union armies, bringing in thousands of recruits from Tennessee, taking the city of Nashville, and after that even moving into Kentucky and beyond. These goals were optimistic in the face of Federal strength, but Hood was determined to gamble&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hood's Last Gamble is an operational-level game for two players exploring the 1864 Franklin-Nashville Campaign. It shares some similarities with the designer's earlier games More Aggressive Attitudes and Objective Shreveport!, but has its own identity and flavor. This one has a larger map with many tricky terrain challenges and more Special Event Cards around which to build your strategy. It utilizes a streamlined approach to the tracking of unit Strength Points that reduces counter clutter and allows for more elegant hidden movement opportunities. Supply counters are crucial to getting the most out of your units, and with winter just around the corner, the Confederate Player must act quickly and decisively in order to change history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
