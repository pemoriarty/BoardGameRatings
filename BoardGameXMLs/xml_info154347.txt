			<description>Also includes the Game of Archery and Game of Morrice.&lt;br/&gt;Double Sided Game Board opens to full color Game of Quoits board on one side (11&amp;rdquo; x 9&amp;rdquo; x 3/4&amp;rdquo;) and the 2 Games of Archery and Morrice on the other side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components: 26 Round Wooden Game Pieces (9 Blue, 9 Natural, 4 Green, 4 Purple).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OF ARCH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implements - Twelve men, a set of three for each player, and the Double Teetotum. The men represent and are called arrows, and are shot at the target by the proper moves. The object of the game is to see who will make the best shots with his three arrows. All moves are made by the spin of the Teetotum, using the mum of the numbers obtained by the spin, and moving an arrow aver a corresponding number of spaces. Spin for lead. The highest spin plays first. The arrows are first entered according to the spin, beginning st. and counting from the space at the flag-staff. After entering, each player, in turn, advances his arrows ac-cording to his spins, until they reach the target. Any arrow that is carried beyond the target by the spin is a miss, and counts nothing. An arrow is carried beyond the target when there are not enough spaces for it to be moved over, to use up the spin. Each ring of the target represents two spaces, one on each side sf the bull's-eye, as though the target were divided by a vertical (meat its center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The arrows are moved from the flag-staff to the target as though the whole formed one continuous line of 23 spaces-7 in the target, and 16 outside. As soon as an arrow reaches the target its move is ended. Two or more arrows of the same, or of opponent players, may 'soupy the same space at the same time. The game is ended when all the arrows have reached or missed the target. Each arrow on the outer circle counts 1; on the next ' circle, 2; on the third circle, 3; and, on the bull's-eye, 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player having the largest count wins the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OF MORRICE (Nine Men's Morris)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implements - Eighteen men in two colors; a set of nine for each player. The charming game of Morrice, which closely resembles, and is probably the source of &amp;quot;Go-Bang,&amp;quot; is the inside game, laid out in black lines, with circular spaces at the points where the lines cross or intersect each other. The object of each player is to get three of his men in a row, that is, upon the three spaces on any one of the straight black lines. All of the lines are used alike, no distinction being made between the long and the short ones. Play in turn throughout the game, and place or move but one man at a time. The players in turn, first place their men, one at a time, upon any vacant circular space, each trying to get three men in a row, and at the same time playing to prevent his opponent doing so. Thus, a player trying to form a row, will lay down two men upon the same ; but the opponent, if on the lookout, will lay down one of his men on the third space of the same line, and stop him. Sometimes players scatter their men in such a manner, that by laying down a single man, they have two ways by which they can form rows, upon their next turn, and as only one of these can be stopped by the opponent, they necessarily gain a point. Each time that a player, forms a row, he captures and removes One of his opponent's men front the board, but must, if possible, take one that will not break his rows. When all the men have been placed upon the board, one at a time, as above described, the players try to form rows by moving their men from space to space, in any direction. Sat all moves must be along the lines, always moving to the next space. As often as a player forms a row, whether in placing or moving his men, he captures one of his oppoaent's men. As soon as either player loses all but two of his men, he can form no more rows, and therefore loses the games&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GAME OF QUOITS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implements - Sixteen men in four colors&amp;mdash;a set for each player, and the Double Teetotum. There are two sets of Quoit spaces, at each side of the board. The first and third players play for one set, and the second and fourth for the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play and spin in turn. The highest spin leads. Use the sum of the numbers indicated by the Teetotum in making the moves, except in case of a doublet, which has its corresponding numbered Quoit space. The first player spins and places his man upon the Quoit space which corresponds to his throw. The others follow in turn playing in the same manner. Four rounds are played in this way, and the score is then made up. The count is as follows : Each man on the hub counts ten ; on a double number, three ; and on the other numbers two. In addition to the above, the man nearest to the hub counts five I the next nearest, three'; and the third, one. If two men hit the same space, the first corner is set back one space, if the rear space is vacant ; if occupied, the man goes for-ward on space, but should this space also be occupied it is removed from the board and does not count for its player. When four rounds have been played, the game is begun anew, and the play continues until some one of the players scores 60, which wins the game. The object of the game may also be to see which will make the highest score in four rounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
