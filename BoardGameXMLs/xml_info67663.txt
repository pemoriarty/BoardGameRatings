							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rooms &amp; Encounters: Pillars of Salt</name>
									
			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you emerge through the salt covered door, your eyes are assaulted by a disorienting contrast of glare and shadow. Like the cramped tunnels leading here, the room inside is limned with salt deposits that cover the walls, floor, and ceiling. Scattered throughout the small chamber, a half dozen or so massive crystalline formations jut in threatening angles like frozen thorn bushes after a midwinter&amp;rsquo;s frost. Strangely, the room is lit by a score of poorly made tallow candles placed haphazardly atop various salt deposits. The room feels hot and dry and moisture seems to be siphoning out of your flesh. As your eyes adjust to the bouncing light, they rest on several dark shadows inside some of the large crystals. As you peer closer, you see within them dried husks of humanoids so badly desiccated that you are unable to determine their original race. Their skins are pulled so tightly that they appear skeletal, though their postures and expressions are eerily preserved in an articulation of unimaginable pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discover Pillars of Salt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dungeon Under the Mountain is a massive dungeon complex extending endlessly below the ground. In a remote past, ancient evil beings dwelled in the area. Now, the remaining of these mysterious evil beings have seized the dungeons and filled it with deadly traps and monsters. Also, many known villains have established their strongholds in the depths of The Dungeon Under the Mountain. Nobody knows why this dungeon is filled by danger, but nobody cares, since this dungeon is the most prized adventure ground of the world. However be warned, adventurers, your life will be not easy here and dozens of self-calling heroes never returned from The Dungeon Under the Mountain!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of a series of products detailing the rooms in the massive The Dungeon Under the Mountain environment. This is Room 10, Level 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This product contains one room or one dungeon-based encounter. All the rooms featured here are taken from one of The Dungeon Under the Mountain products, although these products are not necessary, since the encounter can be adapted without effort to any existing dungeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
