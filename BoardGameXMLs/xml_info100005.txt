							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Nursery Rhymes</name>
									
			<description>52 cards being 13 sets of four cards. The cards depict a character from a nursery rhyme (consisting of three cards, the feet, the head and the middle). The 4th card in a set is the rhyme itself. Further the cards have regular playing card symbols so you could look for all four like cards (for example, Ride a Cock Horse cards are all 4's) and, as an alternative, you could use the deck as a normal deck of cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Play is a mixture of Happy Families and Rummy. In his turn, a player may lay down a set of 4, or he may take the face-up card from the discard pile, or he can draw a face-down card from the deck, or he can ask for a card he believes another player has. Whatever he does, he must maintain a hand of seven cards after his turn has ended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
