			<description>Commercial game, related to Monopoly, for the purpose of promoting the city of &amp;quot;Baden-Baden&amp;quot;, in the Southwest of Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players move around a board, which consists of 40 squares. On most of the squares are parts of companies, which can be bought. The companies have values between 1000 and 8000. Three companies are combined by a color.
