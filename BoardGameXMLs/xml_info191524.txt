			<description>The poor little kangaroos are feeling bored! They've seen a lot of little rabbits hopping around, and have decided to try and catch them and make some new friends.The rabbits have other ideas; there are too many carrots in need of munching, so they'd really rather not get caught!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players each take charge of a group of rabbits, trying to keep them away from the kangaroos. To succeed, they'll need their wits about them, and may be just a bit of luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
