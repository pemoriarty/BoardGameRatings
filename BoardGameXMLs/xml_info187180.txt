			<description>Over three ages of world history, tribes of different peoples move across the Earth. They found settlements, establish foreign relations and develop civilizations. Each people is led by one secret player, who rules its fate and claims its victory points. However, each people may be moved by any player and each age sees a new leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player who accumulates the most victory points over the three ages wins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played on a world map of 144 triangular regions grouped in 6 continents. Each of the 6 peoples have 12 tribes that are randomly distributed over the world. Each player has a secret subject people and a secret ally people each age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players take turns to move tribes, always closer to populated regions where there is space left for them, and group them into settlements. The later the age, the longer the tribes may move and the bigger the settlements may get.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. In the first age, move 1 region at the time. Found 12 villages of 3 tribes each.&lt;br/&gt;2. In the second age, move 2 regions at the time (even across water). Found 9 cities of 6 tribes&lt;br/&gt;each.&lt;br/&gt;3. In the third age, move to any region. Found 6 metropolises of 9 tribes each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of each age, you score for your tribes in the settlements and for the settlements where your people has the majority of the tribes. Resolve ties by adding the tribes of your allied people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the advanced game, you may increase the settlement score by establishing foreign relations and making civilization advances. However, those increases will benefit the leader of the next age&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Peoples, you are faced with tough tactical and strategic questions. Should you enrich your people this age and risk having a poor people the next? Should you make advances that benefit several settlements or only your own? When should a settlement be expanded and when should it be abandoned? The history will judge whether you answered the questions right or wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
