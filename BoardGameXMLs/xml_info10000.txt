							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Roll and Score Poker Game</name>
									
			<description>Each of you will be rolling 15 poker dice in an attempt to form certain card-hand combinations in the first roll when scoring is highest.  If you are unsuccessful, take three more successive rolls, but score fewer points on each roll.  However, you can save any of the dice and roll fewer, if you decide it is to your advantage.  Jokers count against you and are removed from play whenever they appear.  If you are unsuccessful after 4 rolls, score 0.  If you are successful, receive the number of points given on the score sheet for each successive roll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
