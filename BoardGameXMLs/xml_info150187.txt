			<description>Hunt and Seek&amp;trade; Young Xpert is for youngsters who love challenges. Like the other games in the series, this game develops a child&amp;rsquo;s reactions, sense of observation, visual acuity and concentration. Numbers written in French and English allow children to learn the basics of reading a second language. Different levels in the game add to the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the game is to find 50 objects hidden in the beautifully illustrated game boards. Other challenges face players who may try to locate the little mouse found in different locations on the game boards or find the six mystery characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
