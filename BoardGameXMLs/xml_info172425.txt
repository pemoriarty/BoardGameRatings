							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Slaughterball: Team Gruesomes Arena – The Lab</name>
									
			<description>The Lab Arena is in a gothic slaughterdome that broods within the Wallachian Metroplex. Massive generators shoot bolts of electricity above the city as well as through the pits! These random bolts can stun even mighty  butchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lab is an arena board for Slaughterball.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rules:&lt;br/&gt;All coaches gain the following ability while playing a game in the Lab:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shock attack: At any time except during an action, any coach can sacrifice an Interrupt card to call down a bolt of electricity on an athlete in an electricity space (indicated by a faint electricity symbol).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wildly arcing electricity in the pit will likely result in many more knockdowns. This will give the slower Gruesomes more chances to chop and foul. Teams in general will have fewer options because more of their players will be knocked down. With few &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; spaces on the board, teams will clump up, giving the Gruesomes an easier time wading into groups of opponents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
