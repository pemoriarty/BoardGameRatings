							<name primary="true" sortindex="1">Napoleon&#039;s Last Campaigns</name>
									
			<description>From the Rules Folder:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;In 1814 and 1815, Napoleon took on the might of Europe in what proved to be his final campaigns.  The conclusion of each resulted in an abdication -- once he returned, once he did not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1814, Napoleon had the advantage of interior lines, centralized command, and the motivation of fighting for his home soil.  His opponents had none of these -- but they did have overwhelming strength instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1815, Napoleon had the advantage of surprise and concentration.  His opponents were rapidly joining together.  A quick, decisive strike on each separated army by Napoleon could have spelled victory for the French, instead of defeat at Waterloo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In NAPOLEON'S LAST CAMPAIGNS you are faced with the intriguing possibilities for tactical and strategic maneuvers presented by both of these classic campaigns and the fate of victory or defeat lies in your hands and mind.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description of Game Components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two color map, 16&amp;quot; x 14&amp;quot;, depicting North-eastern France from Paris on the west edge of the map to Brussels in the North and Mainz in the East.  Movement is area based (no hexes) and counters represent Corp. sized units.  No other indication of scale is mentioned in the rules.  Games lenth is either 24 turns for the 1814 scenario or 25 turns for the 1815 scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to unit designation and nationality, each unit has two numbers on the face of the counter.  The first number (on the left) represents the &amp;quot;Combat Power&amp;quot; of the unit in the 1814 scenario with the number on the left representing the &amp;quot;Combat Power&amp;quot; of the unit in the 1815 scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequence of play is IGO-UGO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Units may move one area per turn. Rivers and mountains do not hinder movement.  Forest areas take two turns to enter.    French units (ONLY) with supply points may attempt to Force March and move two areas in a turn.  A failed attempt to Force March means the unit does not move at all.  French infantry Force March on a roll (six-sided die) of 1-4.  French Cavalry Force Marches on a roll of 1-5.  Each unit attempting to Force March roll individually.  The Napoleon unit and the French Guards unit may always Force March (no die roll required) if supply is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combat is a two step affair.  In the first step, each player selects a type of attack or defense and cross reference the combination to find the die-roll modification.  The difference between commander ratings also modify the die roll result.  Then the die is rolled on an odds based Combat Results Table and result number is modified by the die-roll modification number determined in the first step.  Combat losses are taken as a percentage of the of the losing forces combat strength.  Combat results can also result in the retreat (one area) of the attacker or defender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
