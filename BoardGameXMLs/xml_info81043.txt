			<description>VOTED TMP's BEST FANTASY RULESET OF 2010!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your troops are tired and slowly giving ground. They've fought hard all day against an infinite number of enemy troops. They've done all that you've asked of them and more. They've covered themselves with both blood and glory and look to you for victory. The fate of your nation hangs in the balance as you desperately search for that one spot to launch your final attack. &lt;br/&gt; There! Gathering your personal horsemen you draw your sword for it is now or never. The battle rests on your strong right arm, the arm of a Warrior, King, and Hero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Typical fantasy game,&amp;quot; you say?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;We say no!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the world of Rally Round the King (RRtK). Populated by Heroes and Demons and everything in between, Rally Round the King takes you to the mythical land of Talomir.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a land where dozens of nations vie for dominance and we've created it just for you. Like other games we've provided you with Army Lists that describe your troops and how to assemble them for battle. But any game allows for fighting individual battles. We've taken it farther, much farther.&lt;br/&gt;We've provided an elegant yet simple campaign system to link all your battles together to insure that every battle means something. Where the chance of victory in your next battle hinges on how you did in your last. With the Rally Round the King campaign system you are the Commander of the Army one minute and the King, or Queen, the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rally Round the King is a fantasy miniatures rules set which features single base units with multiple figures.  Basing can be adapted to single figures if desired.  The rules feature the famous 2 Hour Wargames reaction system adapted to a mass combat engine.  Rules for Command Control, Magic, Heroes and rich fantasy world with 20+ army lists and detailed campaign materials.  The system can easily be adapted to almost any mass combat campaign scenario as well as historical situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you can tell the whole story, your story. Now you can build your empire with both sword and diplomacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trumpets call, your horse is ready. Will you have what it takes when they Rally Round the King?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historical Army Lists are now available as Rally Round the King: Armies &amp;amp; Campaigns 3000 BC to 1500 AD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
