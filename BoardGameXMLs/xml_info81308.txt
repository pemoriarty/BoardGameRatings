			<description>Inspired by the old Getter Robo anime series, Getto Rocket is a 2-player combination DIY board game  that plays very simmilar to Chess with a slight Stratego element to it. The rules and board are printed out from a PDF (the board and 10 pieces may be purchased from the game creator.) The board is a 5 wide by 6 tall illustrated grid of squares depicting the land the two sides are battling over. Each side has 5 colourfull rocket pieces each. 3 Rockets which can move 1 space forward back or sideways, 1 Pin which can move 1 space diagonal, and 1 Bomb which is stationary. These are arranged in 1-2 rows at opposite sides of the board. Each player chooses a &amp;quot;home base&amp;quot; and the objective is to either eliminate all of your opponent's pieces, or take and hold the enemy home base for 3 consecutive turns. Any piece can eliminate any other piece by attacking first. Both are removed if the Bomb is attacked.&lt;br/&gt;The game also comes with 4 different Modifier Cards, 2 of which are randomly dealt each player at the start of the game. At any you may play one of your cards to the board so that it covers any two spaces that you either occupy or are currently free. Each card effects pieces differently. Such as allowing the Rocket to move diagonally while on those two spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally about 1 in 10 games are packed with a special Shifter piece that is randomly swapped for one of the other pieces. The Shifter can move in any direction, can occupy the same space as another friendly unit, and can transport those friendly units with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
