			<description>From the publisher:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the leaves are spiralling downwards in fall and the wind whips them up for a dance ... Can any player turn over a new leaf? Only the necessary skills will gain you victory in this airy game!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the fourth game in the crowdsourcing series Little'N'Nice by Spieltrieb: Take it or leaf it is an exciting dexterity game for the entire family. Two to four players are flicking their playing cards towards the middle of the table. But only the topmost leaf will determine the victory points. And always dependent on the amount of leaves underneath. But be careful! For when a leaf turns in mid-flight, it may be your opponent who gains the points!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take it or leaf it - A game for up to four friends of little, but nice dexterity games, who do not mind getting up during a game from time to time. What is special about this project? Definitely the game mechanics, and they will provide you with lots of fun. Have you not always wanted to own a game that asks you to throw around cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The gameplay of Bl&amp;auml;tterbunt is very simple and and easy to learn, even for younger players.. One player flicks a card on the table. Then it is the next one's turn. Both aim to cover their opponent's cards with their own. After all cards are flicked, points are given to the player whose card is topmost in a pile. Points are then gained depending on the white dots on the leaf cards. The player who is first to reach a previously agreed victory point target (for example 20) wins the game. The short playing time of about 15 to 20 minutes makes the game a perfect filler game.n)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>
